# JavaScript: Password Generator

This is a password generator. It uses five diferent elements to randomly generate a password using specific criteria. This criteria consists of: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, symbols, and character length. The user is given a prompt for each one, where they can decide what criteria they want to include. At the end, a strong password is created based on their input. It's that simple!
